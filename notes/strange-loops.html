    One of those <a href="loops.html">loops</a> is the Gödelian strange loop based on Gödel’s famous “Incompleteness
    theorem”, that arises in
    formal systems in mathematics and which allows such a system to discern itself…to become “self-aware”.

    Coming back to our previous “self”, we know that one’s cranium is a “purely physical object made up of completely
    sterile and inanimate components, all of which obey exactly the same laws as those that govern all the rest of the
    universe.” They key doesn’t lie in those inanimate matter, the atoms the brain is made of, but in the patterns that
    exist inside the brain.

    You get to an “I” from a bunch of meaningless primitives (atoms, molecules etc.) which don’t mean anything. So what
    is the connection between those two? BEG tries to answer this question by going back to our formal <a
      href="mu.html">
      mathematical
      system
    </a>. We start with a bunch of logical primitives ( 3+2=5, etc.) and we’ll get to a bunch of statements that refer
    to themselves. These two systems are somehow equivalent.
