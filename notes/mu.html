    An attempt is made to talk about the strange ideas of Zen Buddhism. The Zen monk Mumon, who gave well known
    commentaries on many kõans, is a central figure. In a way, Zen ideas bear a metaphorical resemblance to some
    contemporary ideas in the philosophy of mathematics. After this "Zennery", Gödel’s fundamental idea of
    Gödel-numbering is introduced, and a first pass through Gödel’s Theorem is made.
