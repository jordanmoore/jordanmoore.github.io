                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p><a href="http://emmet.io/">Emmet</a> (formerly known as Zen Coding) is a plugin for text editors helping you create CSS and HTML faster by using abbreviations to write common values saving ridiculous amounts of time along the way.</p>

<p>There are heaps of really useful features alongside Emmet&#8217;s primary text-expanding function. Here are a few of the hidden gems that I frequently use when coding<sup id="fnref:p91335536701-1"><a href="#fn:p91335536701-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Inline Calculation</h2>

<p>Emmet has a built-in calculator which allows you to solve equations directly in your code. I use this daily to solve EM values in CSS, particularly for nested EM values simply by pressing<sup id="fnref:p91335536701-2"><a href="#fn:p91335536701-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup><kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd> beside an equation like: 24/16 (desired pixel value/base pixel value).</p>

<p>You can also chain this with abbreviations, so typing: <code>mb24/16</code> and pressing <kbd>Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd> then <kbd>tab</kbd> would output: <code>margin-bottom: 1.5em</code>.</p>

<h2>Jump to Matching Pair</h2>

<p>Sometimes when coding HTML I might find a closing tag and it&#8217;s not always quick and easy to trace back to where the opening tag exists. Pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>T</kbd> when the cursor is in the closing (or opening) tag jumps to the opening (or closing) tag pair.</p>

<h2>Code comments</h2>

<p>To prevent running into the situation in the previous tip, I recommend placing comments beside your closing tags. But writing the class name of the element for a second time and wrapping it in comments can take up time, and it&#8217;s extra effort that won&#8217;t be beneficial until you run into scenarios where you need to revisit that code, so it&#8217;s often forgotten about or left out completely.</p>

<p>Thankfully Emmet makes it easier to write comments beneath closing tags by adding a tiny snippet to the end of an abbreviation. Typing: <code>.container&gt;ul&gt;li*5&gt;a|c</code> expands to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- /.container --&gt;</code></pre>

<p>So writing comments where elements close is as easy as writing <code>|c</code>.</p>

<h2>Convert image to Data URI</h2>

<p>One of the most underused features of Emmet is it&#8217;s built-in ability to convert images to data:URI schemes. Using a data:URI instead of linking to an external image saves an extra HTTP request which ultimately improves the performance of your site by reducing latency.</p>

<p>To convert an image to a data:URI, place your cursor in the image tag and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Shift</kbd> <kbd>D</kbd>.</p>

<hr><p>Emmet can be as powerful as you want it to be. It&#8217;s worth using for its text-expansion capabilities alone saving huge amounts of coding time, but beyond that lies a very powerful suite of development tools.</p>

                <p>The “view full site” link has fostered a negative behavioural trait. When faced with problems on a dedicated mobile site users have a tendency to look for the full site link like some sort of safety net.</p>

<p>How often have you arrived on a broken link on a dedicated mobile site from a search engine and looked for the full site link in an attempt to solve the problem? It’s instinctive among web savvy people, but I have witnessed people outside of our industry perform the same behavioural trait in a similar unconscious manner.</p>

<p>The sad truth is “view full site” can also be used by web developers as a safety net if the small screen experience isn’t good enough. The pinch-to-zoom fallback is there when a poor implementation fails and lazy web developers capitalise on the user’s newfound habits of correcting such website issues by clicking this magical link.</p>

<p>This leaves responsive designers in a difficult position. We are already on the back foot when the user arrives at our lovingly tailored responsive experience — we have to convince the user that our responsive design <strong>is</strong> the full experience after years of being misled to think they are getting half a product by dedicated mobile sites overzealous in removing content and stripping back features</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that from the average user’s perspective a dedicated mobile site may not look too different to a responsive site on the surface. If they run into problems with our design or perhaps they expected to see some content that is missing because it was simply overlooked, do they feel misled by default?</p>

<p>So how do we fix this problem? By continuing to fight the good fight with ubiquitous experiences and earning back the user’s trust over time — it’s not going to be a quick fix. Bad habits take time to eradicate. The great content swindle needs to stop.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>After watching Indie Game: The Movie during Channel 4’s video games night I couldn’t help but notice the parallels between game design and web design. There are elements of this that I have noticed before, but I thought I’d share some of the facets of video games that aren’t spoken about so often in relation to our industry.</p>

<p>Note that this isn’t a discussion about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">gamification</a>, rather a look at how game <em>design</em> applies to the web.</p>

<h3>Video games are usability success stories</h3>

<p>Pong is perhaps one of the greatest examples of usability for a digital product. The original Pong arcade box featured two knobs. A knob on one side of the box for player one and one on the other side for player two. Twisting the knob on the either side moved the corresponding on screen paddle up and down.</p>

<p>The box had no instructions. The player was left to learn the behaviour and play.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3743/11189802263_36d1eb76a4_o.png"/><figcaption>The original Pong machine deserves credit for being a usability success</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>More complex games that require extra behaviours to progress (let’s use Tomb Raider as an example) produce scenarios where environmental situations encourage you to recall certain behaviours, perform the input combination on the controller to trigger the behaviour and progress. In fact most games are essentially sequences of pattern recognition.</p>

<p>One of the most enjoyable facets of gaming is when the player is in a state of flow<sup id="fnref:p68879624841-1"><a href="#fn:p68879624841-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and they perform the actions almost instinctively. The game then feels more rewarding to play because the player is progressing at the ideal pacing and feels more at one with the game when difficulty level and ability level are in perfect synergy.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3793/11189680715_eb10fb7e66_o.jpg"/><figcaption>In Tomb Raider the player quickly learns to apply input combinations in relation to environmental features. Some ledges require a running jump rather than a regular jump to progress to the next area</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Repetition plays a key role in establishing these actions in the user’s mind. If you strip the surface texture graphics and reduce the polygon count in Tomb Raider, you would notice that the environments would look quite similar in that they can all be traversed using the same character behaviours but in varied and more challenging ways — the foundations remain the same from the first level through to the end.</p>

<p>There are many lessons we can learn from how games are designed and built and apply the findings to the web. Input combinations that trigger specific actions could appear in the form of <strong>gestures</strong> or even as part of a <strong>visual language</strong>. Think about how games teach you to subconsciously perform such actions using techniques like <strong>pacing</strong> and <strong>repetition</strong> to help engrain them in the user’s intuition.</p>

<p>You might think that kind of thinking could lead to a deviation from established web design patterns” - it all depends on the implementation. Imagine a first person shooter that didn’t bind the fire action to the right shoulder button on a controller or the left mouse button and instead required you to press a button like ’x’. It would be infuriating because it simply doesn’t feel right. Design patterns occur in games too, they’re just sometimes hard to spot because they almost feel like second nature — which is a very good thing.</p>

<h3>Storytelling and narratives</h3>

<p>We can learn a lot from point-and-click adventure games. Not even in regards to the nature of the input for the genre — my favourite point-and-click adventure was Grim Fandango which was labelled a point-and-click adventure even though it was controlled entirely by keyboard — I’m talking about how they are structured in terms of their narratives.</p>

<p>All good stories have a beginning, a middle and an end. Point-and-click adventures are (mostly) linear stories made up of <strong>sequences</strong> that require item collection and puzzle solving to advance to the next sequence. The difference between the web and point-and-click adventures is that the latter wants you to struggle to advance, but not too much. In <em>most</em> cases on the web, that’s not what we want to do, but there are certainly elements from this genre that we can learn from and apply to the web. Adventure games are trying to funnel the user down the linear story without leaving you <em>completely</em> stuck, otherwise the user is less likely to feel compelled to finish the game. It’s the in-between bits that hold this narrative flow together that interests me the most — when the player starts to struggle the game has a job on its hands to keep the player interested and help them back into the narrative so the game can tell its story.</p>

<p>Characters respond to changes in the dynamics of the game. If you are looking for a specific item to proceed to the next sequence and you’re having a hard time doing so, some specific characters will become aware of the situation at hand and perhaps provide help or hints when spoken to.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/11189654275_7470acb045_o.png"/><figcaption>In Grim Fandango speaking to characters you have already met can often provide clues as to how to proceed to the next sequence</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>This sense of situational awareness can apply to the web too. As a user progresses through our own narrative, situational awareness can help the user progress to the next scene. Imagine a user adds an item to their cart in an e-commerce website — the dynamics of the situation have changed from when the user began on their journey and we can help them through to the end of the story. Perhaps the user digresses from the shop after deciding to read a rather interesting article on the store’s blog about how the store has been donating a portion of profits to charity. What if the blog post had a helpful block at the end to inform the user of the change in dynamics? Something to the effect of: “And you can help us donate too by buying that t-shirt in your cart. Would you like to do that now?”</p>

<p>Games speak to the players in plain English. No technical jargon like “Your session has expired” — something informative, clear and to the point, but not abrupt and not too long so that it wastes time either. Narrative content is hard.</p>

<p>We really should listen to video game designers and developers a lot more. I would love to see people like <a href="http://www.raphkoster.com">Raph Koster</a> speak at web design conferences and talk about flow theory, establishing core gameplay and environmental mechanics and the similar challenges we face in both industries. When it comes to telling compelling stories and teaching users to perform instinctual reactions to scenarios, the games industry has been doing this for a long time and have left a lot of good examples for us to learn from.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p>Having recently covered the <a href="http://www.jordanm.co.uk/2013/11/02/responding-to-environmental-lighting-with-css.html-media">luminosity media feature</a>, I thought I&#8217;d take time to document the potential use cases for the other new media features in the CSS Level 4 Media Queries module. Note that at the time of writing these features don&#8217;t exist in any browser yet, so the following use cases are theoretical.</p>

<h3>Introducing Script</h3>

<p>The <code>script</code> media feature does largely the same job as <a href="http://modernizr.com">existing feature detection methods</a> albeit on a more limited scale (browsers that support CSS level 4 media queries). It checks to see if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAscript</a> (commonly in the form of JavaScript on the web) is supported in the current document. That means if a user has JavaScript enabled or disabled in their browser, we can detect its state and make appropriate formatting adjustments in CSS.</p>

<p>There are certain limitations to what the <code>script</code> media feature can detect. If JavaScript is switched off and a page is loaded, the media feature will correctly report a value of &#8220;0&#8221; and it will report a value of &#8220;1&#8221; when JavaScript is enabled. But what happens to the media feature result when the user switches JavaScript off <em>whilst viewing the page</em> depends on the individual browser&#8217;s behaviour — it may or may not report a value of &#8220;0&#8221;. It also can&#8217;t be used as a way of providing a fallback if JavaScript errors cause something to break<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-1"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> because the browser will correctly say that the current document is capable of showing scripts and return a value of &#8220;1&#8221;. The specification hints at future levels of CSS being able to provide fine-grained results of which scripts are allowed to run on a page<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-2"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h3>Use cases for script</h3>

<p>Using the &#8220;not&#8221; keyword in a <code>script</code> media query would allow us to style fallbacks where JavaScript isn&#8217;t enabled. It could also be used for progressive enhancement where the presence of JavaScript isn&#8217;t taken for granted.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a <code>script</code> media query written with progressive enhancement in mind (assuming we have a JavaScript-powered carousel):</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (script) {
    .carousel-links {
        display:inline-block;
                padding: 0.3em 0.6em;
                ...
    }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Introducing Hover</h3>

<p>Similar to the <code>script</code> media feature <code>hover</code> returns a basic on/off (1/0) result depending on whether the primary pointing system on the device can hover<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-3"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. Although touch-based devices may have the potential for hover capable input devices like a mouse, this media query will still report a value of &#8220;0&#8221; before any peripherals are attached.</p>

<p>The <code>hover</code> media feature solves a very common problem. Some UI elements that require a hover interacting like mega drop-down navigation menus often appear on touch-based devices that aren&#8217;t capable of hover functions. Their appearance is usually triggered by media queries based on screen dimensions which is not a reliable method for knowing if a device is capable of touch and/or hover inputs.</p>

<p>Currently the user agent on a touch device mimics a hover in some cases on the first tap of the hover menu item which seems to apply some sort of :hover and :active state. The point is — it&#8217;s not that reliable or user friendly. It takes a bit of guess work for the user to know a single tap activates hover. Thankfully the <code>hover</code> media query can help us fix this issue — as you&#8217;ve probably guessed, it detects the device&#8217;s ability to hover.</p>

<h3>Use cases for hover</h3>

<p>Upon detection of a hover-capable input device we could format our markup to enhance interfaces for such devices (e.g. drop-down menus, tooltips etc).</p>

<p>If we wanted drop down menus to only appear on devices that have hover input devices connected, then we would write:</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (hover) {
    nav ul ul {
        display:none;
                /* Hide the sub menu and position absolutely to the parent li for a CSS-based hover drop down menu */
                ...
    }
        nav ul li:hover ul {
            display:block;
            /* Show the menu on hover of the parent li */
        }
}
</code>
</pre>

<h3>Introducing Pointer</h3>

<p><code>Pointer</code> was generally thought of a way to differentiate between touch and other peripheral-based inputs. The media query produces 3 different values: <strong>none</strong>, <strong>coarse</strong> and <strong>fine</strong> — the assumption being that when implemented a non-touch or mouse-based device (like the 4th generation Kindles) would report &#8220;none&#8221;, an iPhone and iPad would report a value of &#8220;coarse&#8221; and a desktop machine would report &#8220;fine&#8221;.</p>

<p>Coarse means that the pointer limited accuracy. According to the spec<sup id="fnref:p66660448615-4"><a href="#fn:p66660448615-4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, that means that at a zoom level of 1 (your default zoom level) the pointing device would have trouble accurately selecting several small adjacent targets.</p>

<p>Inputs that would give a value of fine would likely be a mouse, a trackpad or even a stylus.</p>

<p>I have a couple of reservations about the <code>pointer</code> media feature and I can see potential misuse or misunderstanding of it.</p>

<p>A potential limitation might be when peripherals are used after the page load. For example would the media query update it&#8217;s values if I decided to switch to a stylus during browsing? Also the spec notes that for accessibility reasons some user agents may report a value of &#8220;coarse&#8221; in an environment where the input would normally be reported as &#8220;fine&#8221;.</p>

<p>The takeaway from all of this? Don&#8217;t rely on a coarse pointer to mean <em>touch</em>. Loading touch UI elements based on the accuracy of the input device is trying to solve a problem with the wrong tools. We should take pointer accuracy at face value — it can only tell us how accurate the input device is, therefore our formatting changes within a <code>pointer</code> media query should only make adjustments to for accuracy rather than input type. If you want to write CSS for touch enabled devices <a href="http://modernizr.com">use Modernizr</a> to detect touch capabilities because relying on the <code>pointer</code> media feature is like relying on a width media query to definitively say &#8220;this browser is a mobile phone&#8221;.</p>

<h3>Use cases for pointer</h3>

<p>The specification provides a good use case where you could theoretically enlarge tricky targets like radio buttons based on the accuracy of the pointer. Perhaps &#8220;coarse&#8221; would be a good default to work from - if we assume that the device is inaccurate then we can progressively enhance for accuracy.</p>

<p>The following code demonstrates how we could potentially improve accuracy on UI elements for devices with inaccurate pointers and reduce their size for devices with accurate pointers:</p>

<pre>
<code>
@media (pointer:coarse) {
  .btn {
        padding: 1.2em 2em;
        font-size: 1.6em;
  }
}

@media (pointer:fine) {
  .btn {
        padding: 0.6em 1em;
        font-size: 1em;
  }
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>The new media features offer great opportunities to progressively enhance our designs. I don&#8217;t think any of them should form the <em>foundation</em> for a design, nor do I think that they were ever intended to be used in such a way. What they do provide is a way for us to finesse the details. Make sure to check <a href="http://jordanm.co.uk/palmreader">PalmReader</a> to see when the new media features arrive on your device.</p>

                </div>
            <div class="container">
              <div class="article-content">
                <p><a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/mediaqueries4/">Media Queries Level 4</a> builds upon the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries/">existing media queries specification</a> that many of us use when we build responsive designs today. The Media Queries Level 4 specification introduces four interesting new media features: <strong>script</strong>, <strong>hover</strong>, <strong>pointer</strong> and <strong>luminosity</strong>. At the time of writing the specification has yet to be implemented in a browser, but that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from exploring the potential use cases.</p>

<p>The luminosity media feature has garnered interest from the web community, it will allow developers to make CSS adjustments based on changes in the ambient lighting in which the device is used. The user&#8217;s device must be equipped with a light sensor to trigger this new media feature.</p>

<p>The most obvious use case for the luminosity media feature is to adapt a design depending on whether the user is reading the page during the day where ambient lighting is brighter or during the night where ambient lighting is darker. We already see this behaviour in a few native apps.</p>

<p><figure><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7352/10715274745_2bb3cf0db0_o.png"/><figcaption><a href="http://digg.com/reader">Digg Reader</a> on iOS can change its theme depending on the brightness of the environmental lighting</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>The thing about designing for the web is we don&#8217;t have the same prior knowledge of the destination device that designers for native apps do. The light sensor&#8217;s sensitivity on an iOS device might be different than an Android device, and the light sensor&#8217;s sensitivity on an Android device might be different to the light sensor of <em>another</em> Android device, so we would need to be careful with the degree of change we make as it could be jarring to devices that have an overly keen light sensor.</p>

<p>The code looks something like this:
<code></code></p>

<pre>
@media (luminosity: normal) {
    body {
        background: #f5f5f5;
        color: #262626;
    }
}
@media (luminosity: dim) {
    body {
        background: #e9e4e3;
    }
}
@media (luminosity: washed) {
    body {
        background: #ffffff;
    }
}
</pre>



<p>A <strong>normal</strong> luminosity level represents the screen being viewed in ideal lighting conditions. I would recommend working from this level as your default — and rather than wrapping those styles in a media query targeted for normal luminosity levels it would probably be best to leave those styles unwrapped so browsers and devices that haven&#8217;t got the capability of seeing the luminosity media feature can see the page in it&#8217;s ideal condition. You can then use the <strong>dim</strong> value to make adjustments for darker environments and <strong>washed</strong> to adjust styles for brighter environments leaving the default styles accessible to all devices whether they are equipped with a light sensor or not.</p>

<p>I mentioned earlier about the potential differences in the light sensor hardware sensitivity — I think this is a key reason not to go over the top with the changes we make within luminosity media queries. Can we definitively say that a cloud passing on front of the sun will not trigger the <strong>dim</strong> luminosity media feature? The last thing I&#8217;d imagine the user wants is a harsh change between light and dark designs that is too easily triggered.</p>

Subtle changes in contrast are key for avoiding a jarring user experience when environmental changes occur</figcaption></figure></p>

<p>As with other facets of web design, we should strive to stay out of the user&#8217;s way when they are trying to enjoy our design. The luminosity media feature has the potential to be the most annoying media query at our disposal, it could be responsible for ushering in a new era of glow in the dark websites — let&#8217;s just be careful with it when it arrives.</p>
