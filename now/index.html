	<p>Things that are of interest to me as of 21st May 2024:</p>
	<h3 id="books">Books</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I'm currently reading&nbsp;<strong>First Things First by Stephen R. Covey</strong>&nbsp;after devouring The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. I always feel the need to give two disclaimers about 7 Habits: #1 it's almost a clich√©-level book in that I assume everyone has read it cover to cover but me, and #2 if you haven't, yet know about it, it's not the type of book you think it is. The title does it a massive disservice. I can only describe it as an operating manual for life. A truly paradigm-shifting book that has benefitted me more outside the world of work.&nbsp;<strong>First Things First</strong>&nbsp;is a deeper dive into one of the habits that I'm currently living out.</li>
		<li>Sigh, I probably shouldn't admit this as a United season ticket holder, but I'm reading&nbsp;<strong>Pep Confidential: the Inside Story of Pep Guardiola's First Season at Bayern Munich by Marti Perarnau</strong>. I am reluctantly facinated about how Pep Guardiola manages to define a philosophy that seems to trancend his teams and when key people are moved in and out of positions and games, the philosophy doesn't flinch. I want to figure out how he does that.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="creativity">Creativity</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I think I'm outgrowing Koala Sampler, but I'm not quite at the stage to move up to a Roland SP404-MK II, so in the meantime I'm going to play around with some of&nbsp;<strong>Teenage Engineering's Pocket Operators</strong>&nbsp;and get creative with my hands away from screens.<ul>
				<li>An increase in screen time has been an unfortunate side effect of using Koala Sampler which has made pursuing digital minimalism tricky.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="company-building">Company Building</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I'm starting a new company with my fellow directors at Dawson Andrews, Andrew Fulton and Shaun Murphy, and I'm navigating that tricky crossroads of trying to fire myself from DA to give the new company a chance of working rather than trying to start it as a side-project, which just won't work. If 7 years of building Dawson Andrews has taught us anything, it's that these things need 100% focus.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I'm back on the&nbsp;<strong>running</strong>&nbsp;wagon, which is nice. I'm turning 40 next year and starting to think any form of fitness was behind me, but I'm on track for over 100km in May (should finish around 125km) which will eclipse anything I managed during lockdown (my previous big running spree).&nbsp;<ul>
				<li>Last time I reached 100km in a month was October 2021 and I bust both knees and injured my right foot in the process, all for a stupid badge on Nike Run Club. This time, I'm at 74.4km, completely pain-free somehow.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
